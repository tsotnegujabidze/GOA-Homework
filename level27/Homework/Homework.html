        <h1 style="color: red; text-align: center;">About me</h1>
        <p style="color: red; text-align: center;">My name is Tsotne Gujabidze. I am a student, leader and mentor's assistant in one 
            of the greatest programming academies known to man kind, GOA. GOA stands for Goal Oriented Academy, this is place where 
            we learn not only coding, but leadership, management, friendship and much more. here we improve our teaching skills, do what we like,
            and get paid for it. I managed to become one of the leaders and mentor's assistants in one day, also the day when georgia won
            2-0 against portugal to qualify in the 2024 euros. To this day, I think that was the best day for me.
